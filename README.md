# Allen Rahbar Portfolio
This is my personal website to present to prospective employers. Users of the site will be able to see my personal info, about me, projects,a small gallery of me teaching and doing volunteer work and download my CV (to see my work history, education etc.) and contact information. This site is targeted for potential employers.

## Features
The features of the site are very basic. The navigation bar is fixed on the page for users to be able to navigate to any page at any time with ease. Cv can be downloaded from header and footer. You can read a little bit about me in the about section and see my picture. In the images section there are a few images of me teaching, my teaching certificate and me volunteering for an animal shelter. In the contact section there is a form to fill out if you wish to contact me.
